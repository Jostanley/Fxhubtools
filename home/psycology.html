        <h1>Trading Psychology</h1>

        <h2>6.1 Why Psychology is 80% of Trading</h2>
        <p>Many beginners believe that success in Forex comes from finding the “perfect strategy.” In reality, experienced traders often say that psychology makes up 80% of trading success, while strategy and technical knowledge only account for 20%.</p>

        <p>Why? Because the market is unpredictable. You can have the best system in the world, but if you cannot control your emotions, you’ll make poor decisions. Fear, greed, impatience, and overconfidence often lead to mistakes like closing trades too early, holding losers too long, or risking too much.</p>

        <p>For example, a beginner may see a trade going slightly into profit and close it too soon out of fear, missing the larger move. On the other hand, greed can cause traders to hold onto winning trades for too long without securing profits, only to watch them turn into losses.</p>

        <p>Trading psychology is about building the right mindset. It means:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sticking to your trading plan even when emotions push you otherwise.</li>
            <li>Accepting losses as part of the game instead of chasing them back.</li>
            <li>Remaining calm under pressure during volatile market movements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In short, trading is less about predicting the market and more about controlling yourself. When you master your psychology, you trade with consistency, patience, and discipline—qualities that separate winning traders from losing ones.</p>

        <h2>6.2 Controlling Greed and Fear</h2>
        <p>Greed and fear are the two most dangerous emotions in trading. Fear makes you hesitate, while greed makes you overtrade. Both can destroy your account if left unchecked.</p>

        <h3>How to Control Them</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use a Trading Plan:</strong> Know your entry, stop-loss, and take-profit before entering a trade.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Small:</strong> Keep risk per trade between 1–2% to reduce emotional pressure.</li>
            <li><strong>Take Profits Wisely:</strong> Use partial closes or trailing stops.</li>
            <li><strong>Stay Neutral:</strong> Treat each trade as one of many, without emotional attachment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6.3 Building Patience and Discipline</h2>
        <p>Patience and discipline are the foundation of consistent trading. Many traders fail because they want instant success. True growth comes from waiting for high-probability setups and following your rules strictly.</p>

        <h3>How to Build Patience & Discipline</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create a Routine:</strong> Trade at specific times instead of watching charts all day.</li>
            <li><strong>Journal Your Trades:</strong> Reviewing mistakes helps you learn self-control.</li>
            <li><strong>Reward Discipline:</strong> Celebrate following your plan, even on losing trades.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid Overtrading:</strong> Focus on quality trades, not quantity.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6.4 How to Develop a Winning Mindset</h2>
        <p>A winning mindset is what separates professionals from amateurs. It’s not about winning every trade—it’s about long-term consistency and process.</p>

        <h3>Characteristics of a Winning Mindset</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Confidence without arrogance:</strong> Believe in your system but accept losses.</li>
            <li><strong>Growth attitude:</strong> Treat every loss as a lesson.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on process, not outcome:</strong> Measure success by discipline, not just profits.</li>
            <li><strong>Resilience:</strong> Adapt to market changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Build It</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Think Like a Business Owner:</strong> Trading is a business with both expenses (losses) and revenue (profits).</li>
            <li><strong>Practice Self-Control:</strong> Never let emotions dictate decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>Visualize Success:</strong> Imagine yourself trading calmly and consistently.</li>
            <li><strong>Surround Yourself with Positivity:</strong> Learn from experienced traders and avoid negativity.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In the end, trading is more about mastering yourself than mastering the market. With a winning mindset, patience, and emotional control, even a simple strategy can become profitable.</p>
