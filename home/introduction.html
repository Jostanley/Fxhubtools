‎<h2>Introduction to Forex.</h2>
‎

<div id = "strong_container"><strong>1.1 What is Forex? </strong>
‎</div>
<p>Forex, short for Foreign Exchange, is the global marketplace where currencies are bought and sold. It is the largest and most liquid financial market in the world, with more than $6 trillion traded every single day. Unlike a traditional stock exchange, Forex has no central location. Instead, it is conducted electronically through a network of banks, brokers, institutions, and individual traders across the world.</p>
<div id="container_image">
  <img src="../icons/forex.jpg" alt="forex market" width = "100%" height ="70%">  
</div>
‎
<p>When you exchange money for travel—for example, converting U.S. Dollars to Euros at the airport—you’ve participated in Forex. The difference in rates you encounter is a small reflection of how currencies constantly fluctuate in value. Traders take advantage of these fluctuations to make profits.</p>
‎
<p>Forex is always traded in pairs, such as EUR/USD (Euro vs U.S. Dollar) or GBP/JPY (British Pound vs Japanese Yen). When you buy one currency, you are automatically selling another. The goal of Forex trading is to predict whether the value of one currency will rise or fall relative to the other.</p>
‎
<p>What makes Forex unique is its accessibility. With a computer or even a smartphone, anyone can start trading. There are no physical barriers, and the market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week, giving flexibility to people in different time zones.</p>
‎
<p>‎In summary, Forex is not just for banks and financial institutions—it is a market where beginners and professionals alike can participate, speculate, and potentially profit from the continuous movement of global currencies.</p>
‎
‎
‎
‎
<div id="strong_container"><strong>‎1.2 How the Forex Market Works</strong>
‎
<p>‎The Forex market works through a decentralized system known as the over-the-counter (OTC) market. This means there is no physical exchange where currencies are traded, unlike the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Instead, trading happens electronically across a network of banks, brokers, institutions, and individuals worldwide.</p>
‎
<p>‎Currencies are always traded in pairs because the value of one currency is determined relative to another. For example, in the EUR/USD pair:</p>
‎
<h5>‎EUR is the base currency.</h5>
‎
 <h5>‎USD is the quote currency.</h5>
‎
‎
<p>‎If EUR/USD = 1.2000, it means 1 Euro equals 1.20 U.S. Dollars. Traders speculate whether this price will go up or down. If a trader believes the Euro will strengthen against the Dollar, they buy EUR/USD. If they believe the Euro will weaken, they sell EUR/USD.</p>
‎
<p>‎The market operates on supply and demand. Factors like economic news, interest rates, inflation, and political stability can all influence currency values. A strong economy generally makes a currency stronger, while uncertainty or crisis weakens it.</p>
‎
<p>‎Unlike stock markets, which have set opening and closing hours, Forex runs 24 hours a day across different sessions:</p>
‎
<h5>Asian Session (Tokyo)</h5>
‎
<h5>‎European Session (London)</h5>
‎
<h5>‎American Session (New York)</h5>
‎
‎
<p>‎This allows traders to find opportunities at almost any time of the day. Liquidity is highest when sessions overlap (e.g., London and New York).</p>
‎<div>
    <img src="../icons/currency.png" alt="currency market" width="100%" height ="70%">
</div>
<p>‎In essence, the Forex market works by connecting buyers and sellers globally, driven by speculation, economic events, and the constant need for currency exchange.</p>
‎
‎
‎
‎
<strong>‎1.3 The Importance of Forex in the Global Economy</strong>
‎
</p>‎Forex plays a vital role in the global economy because it facilitates international trade, investment, and financial stability. Without Forex, global commerce as we know it today would be nearly impossible.</p>
‎
<p>‎Consider this example: A company in US imports products from Europe. To pay for these goods, the US company must convert its local currency (dollar) into Euro. This conversion happens through the Forex market. Similarly, when tourists travel abroad, they must exchange their home currency for the local one.</p>
‎<div id="container_image">
    <img src="../icons/currency_convert.png" alt="" width="100%" height="70%">
</div>
<p>‎Governments and central banks also use Forex. They manage their currency reserves and intervene in the market to stabilize their economies. For instance, if a country’s currency becomes too strong, it can hurt exports because goods become expensive for foreign buyers. Central banks may then take actions in the Forex market to weaken their currency slightly, keeping trade competitive.
‎</p>
<p>‎On a larger scale, Forex is crucial for global investments. Investors from one country can easily invest in assets abroad by converting currencies. Forex also acts as a risk management tool, allowing businesses to hedge against currency fluctuations that could affect profits.</p>
‎
<p>‎The Forex market is also a barometer of global confidence. When uncertainty arises—such as during wars, recessions, or pandemics—currencies of stable economies (like the U.S. Dollar or Swiss Franc) often strengthen as investors seek safety.</p>
‎
<p>‎In summary, Forex is not just for traders. It is the backbone of global commerce, trade, tourism, and investment, making it one of the most important systems in the world economy.
‎</p>
‎

‎
<strong>‎1.4 Advantages of Trading Forex</strong>
‎
<p>‎Forex trading offers several advantages that attract millions of traders worldwide, from complete beginners to financial institutions.</p>
‎
<h3>‎1. High Liquidity</h3> <p>Forex is the most liquid market in the world. This means there are always buyers and sellers, so trades can be executed quickly without major delays.</p>
‎
‎
<h3>‎2. Accessibility </h3> <p>Unlike stock or futures trading, Forex is accessible to anyone with a computer, smartphone, and internet connection. Many brokers allow beginners to start with as little as $10–$100.</p>
‎
‎
<h3>‎3. Open 24 Hours </h3> <p>The Forex market operates 24 hours a day, 5 days a week. This gives traders flexibility to trade at times that suit them, whether early in the morning, late at night, or during lunch breaks.</p>
‎
‎
<h3>‎4. Profit in Rising or Falling Markets </h3> <p>Unlike stocks, where profits mainly come from buying low and selling high, Forex allows traders to profit whether the market is going up or down. You can buy if you think a currency will rise, or sell if you think it will fall.</p>
‎
‎
<h3>‎5. Leverage </h3> <p>Forex brokers offer leverage, meaning you can control a larger position with a smaller amount of money. For example, with 1:100 leverage, $100 can control $10,000 worth of currency. While leverage increases profit potential, it also increases risk, so it must be used wisely.</p>
‎

</div>
<h3>‎6. Variety of Strategies </h3> <p>Whether you are a scalper (fast trades), swing trader (holding trades for days), or long-term investor, Forex accommodates different trading styles.</p>
‎
‎
‎
<p>‎In short, Forex provides freedom, flexibility, and countless opportunities for those willing to learn and apply proper risk management. This is why it continues to be one of the most attractive financial markets in the world.</p>
